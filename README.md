## Introduction

This project focuses on evaluating the responses of ChatGPT-4, ChatGPT, Gemini, and Mistral through the lens of conversational QA datasets from CoQA, DialFact, FaVIQ, and CoDAH. By comparing their performance, we aim to provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each language model.

## Project Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is to:

- Evaluate responses of different LLMs using conversational QA datasets.
- Conduct a "Battle of LLMs" with datasets including CoQA, DialFact, FaVIQ, and CoDAH.
- Provide a platform for testing and comparing LLMs' capabilities.

## Used Datasets

|---------|--------------------------------------------|
| CoQA    | Conversational Question Answering          |
| DialFact| Dialogue-based Fact Verification           |
| FaVIQ   | Facts and Verification in Questions        |
| CoDAH   | Conversational Datasets Adversarial Hardness|


## ChatGPT 

ChatGPT, a product of OpenAI's advanced language models, brings versatile natural language understanding and generation to your fingertips. Rooted in the powerful Transformer architecture, it seamlessly integrates into applications through the OpenAI API. With pre-training on diverse internet text and fine-tuning for conversations, ChatGPT excels at dynamic and context-aware interactions. However, users should be aware of occasional limitations in specific scenarios.

You can use ChatGPT on this website [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) and gain access to its API key through the OpenAI platform and follow the installation process  at [OpenAI Developer Portal](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).


## Gemini 

### Purpose

Gemini stands out as an influential tool in the realm of text and image processing, showcasing its prowess through the seamless integration of multimodal prompting. In the domain of text processing, it exhibits the ability to craft imaginative and inventive responses, spanning a spectrum from compelling narratives to evocative poetry. Its versatility extends to image processing, where it empowers users to generate personalized artwork and conceptual visualizations by translating text prompts into captivating visual representations.

The unique strength of Gemini lies in its capacity to synergize these diverse capabilities, enabling it to tackle intricate tasks with remarkable finesse. Notably, it excels in tasks that demand the harmonious fusion of textual and visual elements, such as the generation of cohesive stories interweaving both mediums or the provision of vivid and articulate captions for images.

For a more in-depth exploration of Gemini and its myriad capabilities, enthusiasts and users are encouraged to visit the official Gemini AI website. There, a wealth of information awaits, providing comprehensive insights into the tool's functionalities and diverse applications. Ultimately, Gemini serves as a powerful and innovative solution for those seeking to unlock new dimensions of creativity and efficiency in text and image processing tasks.
