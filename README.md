# Battle of LLM's

Welcome to Battle of LLM's, a project that evaluates the responses of various language models (LLMs) including ChatGPT-4, ChatGPT, Gemini, and Mistral. This project leverages conversational QA datasets from CoQA, DialFact, FaVIQ, and CoDAH for testing these LLMs, comparing their performance, and providing insights into their capabilities.

## Introduction

This project focuses on evaluating the responses of ChatGPT-4, ChatGPT, Gemini, and Mistral through the lens of conversational QA datasets from CoQA, DialFact, FaVIQ, and CoDAH. By comparing their performance, we aim to provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each language model.

## Project Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is to:

- Evaluate responses of different LLMs using conversational QA datasets.
- Conduct a "Battle of LLMs" with datasets including CoQA, DialFact, FaVIQ, and CoDAH.
- Provide a platform for testing and comparing LLMs' capabilities.

## Used Datasets

| Dataset | Description                                |
|---------|--------------------------------------------|
| CoQA    | Conversational Question Answering          |
| DialFact| Dialogue-based Fact Verification           |
| FaVIQ   | Facts and Verification in Questions        |
| CoDAH   | Conversational Datasets Adversarial Hardness|


## ChatGPT 

Our script automates the process of sending queries to ChatGPT, saving responses, and handling hourly limits per account. Refer to the installation guide [here](#) for detailed instructions on setting up your API key.
