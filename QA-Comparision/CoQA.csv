While hosts New Zealand have enjoyed a relatively smooth and unbeaten passage to the finale of the global showpiece at Eden Park, France have been beaten twice and failed to hit their top form. 

But McCaw, who was left in tears as the All Blacks stumbled to a 20-18 quarterfinal defeat to the French in the 2007 World Cup, said Saturday that negative media coverage had given Les Bleus extra motivation to spring another upset. 

""I've got no doubt the French are going to play their best game and you blokes have loaded the gun for them,"" he told gathered reporters at the official press conference. 

""They've got players who've been around for a long time and they understand what it takes to win Test matches."" 

And as to France's indifferent form, including a 37-17 loss to his team and a dismal defeat against Tonga in the pool stages, McCaw believes it counts for nothing. 

""In a final it's not about who 'deserves' what,"" said McCaw. 

""It's about who goes and plays the best rugby on that stage, in this game, that's what we've got to do.""

20,cnn,"Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN) -- An 80-year-old Japanese man on Thursday became the oldest person to reach the top of Mt. Everest, officials said. 

Yuichiro Miura reached the top of Everest Thursday morning with his physician son Gota, mountaineering official Gyanendra Shrestha said from the base of Everest. 

Miura's achievement eclipses that of a Nepali man who climbed Everest at age 76 in 2008. 

The oldest woman to climb Everest is also a Japanese. She was 73 when she reached the top last year. 

Miura broke his hip in an accident two years ago, and he underwent heart surgery in January. 

""I am still healthy and strong. I think I have a good chance to reach the summit of Everest,"" he said via phone earlier this month. 

To prepare, Miura walked three times a week with loads of 25 to 30 kilograms (55 to 66 lbs) on his back. 

He reached the top of the 8,848-meter (29,035-foot) peak twice before: in 2003 at age 70, and in 2008 at age 75. 

""I have a dream to climb Everest at this age,"" he said. ""If you have a dream, never give up. Dreams come true."" 

This year marks the 60th anniversary of the first expedition to reach the summit of Everest: Sir Edmund Hilary and Tenzing Norgay made it to the top of the mountain on May 29, 1953. 

Earlier this month, a 27-year-old graphic designer has made history by becoming the first Saudi woman to conquer the mount.

60,cnn,"London (CNN) -- When Andy Murray won the Brisbane International, a warmup event for January's Australian Open, few were surprised. 

But what followed was largely out of character for a man who is perceived as one of the more dour characters in the world of sport. 

After winning the final, Murray turned towards the television cameras and showed a side of himself that had so rarely been seen. 

""I'd like to dedicate this victory to one of my best friends,"" the British tennis star told the crowd. ""He's back home watching and you're going to get through."" 

Thousands of miles away in London, Murray's former roommate Ross Hutchins sat facing the prospect of six months of grueling chemotherapy after being diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma -- a cancer of the lymph node immune system. 

Friends since their early years and former doubles partners, the two were inseparable on and off the court, with both taking time to tease one another about their receding hairlines. 

But not even Hutchins, who has seen a side of Murray that few others have caught a glimpse of, expected such a gesture. 

""I didn't expect the speech, that's for sure,"" the Englishman told CNN's Open Court. 

""I just expected him to, well I was hoping he would win the title ... we had been very close that week as we always are.

83,cnn,"(CNN) -- Looks like Dave Chappelle is making up for lost time. 

The comedian, who famously and abruptly quit his acclaimed, wildly popular ""Chappelle's Show"" on Comedy Central in 2005 and dropped out of public life, seems to be a bit less reclusive these days. 

He recently appeared on the ""Late Show With David Letterman,"" telling the host he never actually quit but was instead ""seven years late for work."" He also ""crashed"" morning show ""Today"" by banging on the glass window and holding a sign advertising his comedy shows at Radio City Music Hall. 

On Wednesday night, Chappelle played Radio City for a two-hour concert that the New York Daily News said showed he had ""returned with his irreverent and often raunchy sense of humor fully intact."" 

""I'm just here to make enlightened money so I can disappear again,"" the paper quoted Chappelle as saying during his stand-up. 

The New York Times noted that Chappelle's act reflected his almost a decade of absence from the set. 

""Once you chat with Matt Lauer while holding a handmade sign plugging your new shows, your days as a reclusive rebel are over,"" Jason Zinoman of The New York Times wrote. ""That shift is reflected in his comedy."" 

Chappelle has had a few pop-up and one-off performances over the years, including one in which he stormed off a Hartford, Connecticut, stage after being heckled. Sporting a more buff look but still chain-smoking cigarettes, Chappelle reportedly joked at Radio City about everything from the Donald Sterling controversy to life as a married father.

103,cnn,"(CNN) -- As prodigal golfer Tiger Woods resumes the world's No. 1 ranking, his chief sponsor, Nike, unveiled a slogan Tuesday that provokes robust debate on what is redemption and has Woods attained it. 

""Winning takes care of everything"" is what Nike declared on its social media outlets after Woods completed his long climb back to the top ranking, more than three years after his extramarital affairs ruined his marriage and embarrassed him. Woods and ex-wife, Elin Nordegren, have two children. 

Many fans and consumers are now raging against the new campaign by Nike, which stood by Woods in his fall from grace as most other sponsors dumped him. 

""Will not buy anything Nike again,"" wrote Melissa Santa-Cruz of Wisconsin on Nike's Facebook page. 

""THIS AD MAKES ME SICK!"" wrote Julie Drake, a high school teacher who said she will use the ad for a classroom discussion. ""Shame on you!"" 

Others, however, endorsed the slogan. 

""Love your Ad Nike,"" wrote Brian Edwards. ""Keep up the good work."" 

Opinion: For Tiger, winning does take care of everything 

The passionate opinions roil during a week when redemption is on the minds of Jews celebrating Passover and Christians preparing for Easter. 

The controversy grows from whether winning indeed absolves transgressions -- and even prompts a return to grace. The narrative plays out in different ways for different public figures. 

""I think that winning, especially in Tiger Woods' case, really does change things because it reminds people why they fell in love with him years ago. It was for his game and his ability to consistently make those tough shots over and over again.

This statement is being met with mixed reactions from fans, some of whom are supporting the statement, while others are criticizing it, saying that the slogan trivializes Woods' past actions and suggests that his success in golf is more important than his personal behavior.

110,cnn,"(CNN) -- As prodigal golfer Tiger Woods resumes the world's No. 1 ranking, his chief sponsor, Nike, unveiled a slogan Tuesday that provokes robust debate on what is redemption and has Woods attained it. 

""Winning takes care of everything"" is what Nike declared on its social media outlets after Woods completed his long climb back to the top ranking, more than three years after his extramarital affairs ruined his marriage and embarrassed him. Woods and ex-wife, Elin Nordegren, have two children. 

Many fans and consumers are now raging against the new campaign by Nike, which stood by Woods in his fall from grace as most other sponsors dumped him.

123,cnn,"(CNN) -- In most of the country, employers can force pregnant workers out of the workplace when their pregnancy interferes with their normal job duties. 

Heather Wiseman, a retail sales associate, lost her job because consuming water while working, an activity necessary to maintain a healthy pregnancy, violated store policy. 

Victoria Serednyj, a nursing home activity director, lost her job because her pregnancy interfered with her ability to lift heavy tables. Her employer terminated her employment even though lifting tables ""took up a small part, roughly five to 10 minutes"" of her day and her co-workers volunteered to perform this task. 

Workers covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act, by contrast, can continue working despite their physical limitations. 

The Americans with Disabilities Amendments Act of 2008 broadened the ADA to include many short-term and relatively minor physical conditions. Pregnant women who experience comparable physical limitations should also have the opportunity to receive accommodations that will enable them to continue working. 

According to EEOC regulations issued in 2011, the amended ADA requires employers to accommodate persons who experience ""shortness of breath and fatigue when walking distances that most people could walk without experiencing such effects."" 

It also requires employers to accommodate persons with back injuries resulting in a ""20-pound lifting restriction that lasts or is expected to last for several months."" In some circumstances, even a far more common 50-pound lifting restriction may qualify an individual for ADA coverage. 

To date, courts have balked at including pregnancy within the Americans with Disabilities Act. They've reasoned the physical limitations accompanying pregnancy are too short-term and minor to qualify as disabilities. ",What are employers able to do to pregnant workers?,fired them,"In most of the country, employers can force pregnant workers out of the workplace when their pregnancy interferes with their normal job duties.

142,cnn,"(CNN) -- Two former presidents reflected on their greatest regrets in office Monday, each looking back to issues that continue to plague the nation years later. 

Former presidents and political rivals Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush now share philanthropic efforts. 

Former Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton appeared together at a question-and-answer forum before the National Automobile Dealers Association in New Orleans, Louisiana. 

Asked his biggest regret after leaving office, Bush said he now wonders whether he should have tried to get Saddam Hussein to leave office at the end of the first Gulf War in 1991. 

He told the gathering, ""I've thought a lot about it, but at the end of Desert Storm, the question was should we have kind of kept going on that road to death and all this slaughter until Saddam Hussein showed up and laid his sword on the table, surrendered. And the common wisdom was he wouldn't do that."" 

But he said a conversation with an FBI agent who interrogated Saddam after he was captured has made him reconsider. 

Bush recalled their talk, ""I said, 'What if we just say he has to come to surrender, would he have done it?' And this guy said, 'I'm absolutely convinced he would have.' My experts tell me he wouldn't have."" 

Bush said, ""We ended it the way we said we would"" as a military success, but noted a cleaner ending ""would have been perfect."" 

He added, ""If we had tried to get Saddam Hussein to come and literally surrender and put his sword on the table, I think it might have been avoided some of the problems that we did have in the future from him.""

143,cnn,"(CNN) -- If they were handing out awards for courage in the face of personal trauma, 70-year-old Bob Yelton would scoop the lot at this week's World Amateur Handicap Championships. 

Yelton is one of just 13 golfers who have played in all 28 previous editions of the biggest tournament of its type in the world, which brings nearly 3,100 players from 25 countries and 49 states of the U.S. to the Myrtle Beach area of South Carolina. 

His streak was nearly broken last year, and in the circumstances nobody would have held it against him if he had taken time out. 

Just before the tournament, Martha, his wife of 22 years, was taken ill and passed away just a week later. 

There had been no hint of a problem -- Martha taught at a community school in Shelby in North Carolina and played a bit of golf herself. 

""She mostly just walked the course with me,"" recalled Bob. 

Her death hit him hard and he was left with the prospect of raising his then 15-year-old son Porter alone. In the circumstances, his annual pilgrimage to Myrtle was low priority. ""I had no interest in playing golf."" 

But with encouragement from his brother Don, who has also played in every World Am, and crucially an intervention from his son, Bob did indeed pitch up. 

""Dad, Mum would have wanted you to play,"" said Porter and he did, thinking about Martha just about every step of the way. 

In retrospect, the stress of dealing with his wife's premature death and continuing to practice as a business lawyer may well have taken a bigger toll on Bob than he was to realize. ",What sport does Yelton play?,golf,"Bob Yelton plays golf.

162,cnn,"(CNN) -- The Atlanta Hawks organization's issues with race go beyond one inflammatory email or offensive comments on one conference call, the team's CEO said, before promising fans that those systemic problems will be corrected. 

""As an organization, we must own these shortcomings and failures,"" Steve Koonin wrote in an open letter Saturday to his team, fans and the city of Atlanta. ""... We should build bridges through basketball, not divide our community or serve as a source of pain."" 

Koonin's comments come a day after general manager Danny Ferry began an indefinite leave of absence tied to controversial comments he made in June about Luol Deng, then a prospective free agent player. And they occurred six days after the franchise's owner, Bruce Levenson, announced he would sell his controlling interest team in light of a 2012 email that many derided as racist. 

In the same announcement last Sunday setting the stage for Levenson's exit, the NBA said that Koonin will oversee team operations during the ownership transition. 

The Hawks CEO did not mention Levenson or Ferry specifically in his letter Saturday, nor did he delve into detail into their or possible other cases. But he did say that ""we enough today, based on investigations conducted by the league, by external legal counsel on behalf of the team and information that has appeared in the media, that our shortcomings are beyond a single email, a single person or a single event.

172,cnn,"The rare moments Christos Sourovelis can take a break from running his own painting business, he can be found toiling away on his family's dream house in the suburbs of Philadelphia. 

""I'm a working guy. I work every day, six days a week, even seven if I have to,"" Sourovelis says. One day this past March, without warning, the government took his house away, even though he and his wife, Markella, have never been charged with a crime or accused of any wrongdoing. 

""I was so upset thinking somebody's going to take my house for nothing. That makes me crazy,"" Sourovelis says, shaking his head. 

The nightmare began when police showed up at the house and arrested their 22-year-old son, Yianni, on drug charges -- $40 worth of heroin. Authorities say he was selling drugs out of the home. The Sourvelises say they had no knowledge of any involvement their son might have had with drugs. 

A month-and-a-half later police came back -- this time to seize their house, forcing the Sourvelises and their children out on the street that day. Authorities came with the electric company in tow to turn off the power and even began locking the doors with screws, the Sourvelises say. Authorities won't comment on the exact circumstances because of pending litigation regarding the case. 

Police and prosecutors came armed with a lawsuit against the house itself. It was being forfeited and transferred to the custody of the Philadelphia District Attorney. Authorities said the house was tied to illegal drugs and therefore subject to civil forfeiture. ",What does Christos do for a living?,unknown,"Christos Sourovelis runs his own painting business.

173,cnn,"Eminem got sober, Arcade Fire got spooked, Katy Perry flashed her hits and Kanye sang one for jerk-offs everywhere. 

(RollingStone.com) -- 5. Arcade Fire, ""We Used to Wait"" 

""Now our lives are changing fast,"" sings Win Butler, spooked and sleepless. But his empathetic croon -- and his band's orchestral- rock wallop -- make high anxiety sound almost sublime. 

4. Katy Perry, ""Teenage Dream"" 

Co-written by Max Martin and Dr. Luke, this buoyant electro-pop singalong is 2010's catchiest tune. As for that ""teenage dream,"" Perry doesn't mince words: ""Let's go all the way tonight."" 

3. Sade, ""Soldier of Love"" 

Nobody knows where Sade disappears to for years at a time between hits, but ""Soldier of Love"" proves she knows how to make a hell of a re-entrance. She sings about emotional devastation over a beat that mixes quiet-storm synths with acid-damaged riffs straight out of TV on the Radio's playbook. It's as close as she's ever come to blowing her cool. 

Rolling Stone's top five albums of 2010 

2. Cee Lo Green, ""F*** You"" 

The title alone would have guaranteed hundreds of thousands of Web clicks. But Cee Lo didn't just say ""F*** you"" -- he said it with humor and serious panache. Despite the bummed-out lyrics, the Motown-style beat is DayGlo-bright, and Cee Lo's lovelorn lament doubles as an anthem for lean times: ""If I was richer/I'd still be with ya/Ha, now ain't that some shit?"" 

1. Kanye West feat. Pusha T, ""Runaway"" 

It takes a special kind of dark, twisted genius to raise the white flag of surrender while raising a middle finger. Kanye West is that genius. ""Runaway"" is Kanye's musical response to the Taylor Swift affair, but it's much more than that: a nine-minute meditation on romantic failure and public infamy.

(RollingStone.com) -- 5. Arcade Fire, ""We Used to Wait"" 

""Now our lives are changing fast,"" sings Win Butler, spooked and sleepless. But his empathetic croon -- and his band's orchestral- rock wallop -- make high anxiety sound almost sublime. 

4. Katy Perry, ""Teenage Dream"" 

Co-written by Max Martin and Dr. Luke, this buoyant electro-pop singalong is 2010's catchiest tune. As for that ""teenage dream,"" Perry doesn't mince words: ""Let's go all the way tonight."" 

3. Sade, ""Soldier of Love"" 

Nobody knows where Sade disappears to for years at a time between hits, but ""Soldier of Love"" proves she knows how to make a hell of a re-entrance. She sings about emotional devastation over a beat that mixes quiet-storm synths with acid-damaged riffs straight out of TV on the Radio's playbook. It's as close as she's ever come to blowing her cool.

2. Cee Lo Green, ""F*** You"" 

The title alone would have guaranteed hundreds of thousands of Web clicks. But Cee Lo didn't just say ""F*** you"" -- he said it with humor and serious panache. Despite the bummed-out lyrics, the Motown-style beat is DayGlo-bright, and Cee Lo's lovelorn lament doubles as an anthem for lean times: ""If I was richer/I'd still be with ya/Ha, now ain't that some shit?""

202,cnn,"(CNN) -- Felipe Massa has been forced to backtrack on comments he made claiming that new Ferrari teammate Fernando Alonso was aware of Renault's plans to deliberately crash at the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix. 

Felipe Massa is still showing the scars of his horror crash at the Hungarian GP in July. 

Alonso won that race after the safety car was brought out when Renault's No. 2 driver Nelson Piquet Jr spun out on lap 14, and Massa subsequently claimed it cost him that year's world title as he finished one point behind champion Lewis Hamilton. 

Motorsport's ruling body the FIA cleared Alonso of any wrongdoing as it banned Renault boss Flavio Briatore, who quit his role before the ruling, while Piquet was immune from prosecution in return for giving evidence. 

Massa told reporters in his native Brazil on Wednesday that he believed two-time world champion Alonso -- who is replacing Kimi Raikkonen at Ferrari next year -- must have known about Renault's race plan. 

""It was the team and Nelson -- but Alonso was part of the problem. He knew. We cannot know it, but of course he knew. It's an absolute certainty,"" he said ahead of this weekend's Brazilian Grand Prix. 

However, the 28-year-old later released a statement on the official Ferrari Web site in a bid to avoid conflict with his future teammate.

""What I've said is the outcome of a hunch I've had and is not based on any concrete evidence,"" Felipe said.

",Who did Massa give the interview to?,reporters,"It is not specified in the given information why Piquet was not banned.

"
216,cnn,"(CNN) -- Felipe Massa has been forced to backtrack on comments he made claiming that new Ferrari teammate Fernando Alonso was aware of Renault's plans to deliberately crash at the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix. 

Felipe Massa is still showing the scars of his horror crash at the Hungarian GP in July. 

Alonso won that race after the safety car was brought out when Renault's No. 2 driver Nelson Piquet Jr spun out on lap 14, and Massa subsequently claimed it cost him that year's world title as he finished one point behind champion Lewis Hamilton. 

Motorsport's ruling body the FIA cleared Alonso of any wrongdoing as it banned Renault boss Flavio Briatore, who quit his role before the ruling, while Piquet was immune from prosecution in return for giving evidence. 

Massa told reporters in his native Brazil on Wednesday that he believed two-time world champion Alonso -- who is replacing Kimi Raikkonen at Ferrari next year -- must have known about Renault's race plan.

234,cnn,"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- He's been labeled by many as the ""reformist,"" a man who can take Iran beyond the truculent anti-Western rhetoric of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. 

Moussavi was not seen as a reformer during his stint as prime minister during the 1980s. 

So, when Iran's government announced over the weekend that Mir Hossein Moussavi had lost in his bid to become the country's next president, young Iranians took to the streets by the thousands alleging ballot fraud. 

Thousands of others around the globe championed the cause on social-networking Web sites and agreed to wear green on Monday in solidarity with Moussavi's supporters. 

But what is often lost in the outrage is whether Iran would look different under a Moussavi presidency. Watch more about the vote » 

Though the 67-year old is credited for successfully navigating the Iranian economy as prime minister during a bloody eight-year war with Iraq in the 1980s, he also was a hard-liner whom the Economist described as a ""firm radical."" 

He, like most Iranians in power, does not believe in the existence of Israel. He defended the taking of hostages at the U.S. Embassy in Iran in 1979, which led to the break in ties between the countries. 

He was part of a regime that regularly executed dissidents and backed the fatwa against British author Salman Rushdie. 

And as late as April, he opposed suspending the country's nuclear-enrichment program but said it would not be diverted to weapons use. 

""I wouldn't go as far as (call it) a 'Velvet Revolution,'"" Trita Parsi, president of the National Iranian American Council, said of the phrase many are using to describe the rallies in Iran. ",Why did the Iranian youth get so angry?,Mir Hossein Moussavi had lost in his bid to become the country's next president - Moussavi lost the election,"The Iranian youth got angry because they believe that there was ballot fraud in the presidential election and that their candidate, Mir Hossein Moussavi, had lost unfairly. They took to the streets in large numbers to protest the government's announcement of the election results. They also received support from thousands of Iranians around the globe who championed their cause on social-networking websites and agreed to wear green in solidarity with Moussavi's supporters. They felt that Moussavi's campaign represented a change from the truculent anti-Western rhetoric of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and his loss was seen as a setback for the hopes of political and social reform in Iran.

""I'm separated from my husband right now, which has been a very difficult thing to go through,"" she told Billboard's ""Pop Shop"" podcast. ""In the beginning, the album was a lot heavier and a lot darker, because I had to get that out. Once I did get that out, a lot of fun came.""

274,cnn,"Washington (CNN) -- A former CIA base chief wanted by Italy and detained in Panama has been released, a State Department spokeswoman said Friday. 

Robert Seldon Lady, who had been convicted by an Italian court for his role in a 2003 rendition case, was flying back to the United States. 

""It's my understanding that he is in fact either en route or back in the United States. Beyond that I have no further details,"" State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf told reporters. 

In a 2009 trial, an Italian court convicted Lady and 22 others of abducting Osama Mustafa Hassan Nasr, or Abu Omar, from the streets of Milan in 2003. Italian prosecutors said Abu Omar was nabbed by a CIA team working with Italian officials. 

The trial was the first to deal with a practice that human rights groups call ""extraordinary rendition."" They say the United States has often transferred terrorism suspects to countries that practice torture. 

Abu Omar, who was suspected of recruiting men to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan and was under heavy surveillance by Italy's intelligence agency, was transferred to Egypt and tortured, Italian prosecutors said. 

A former senior CIA official said Lady is no longer with the CIA. 

In the 2009 trial, the Italian court sentenced Lady to eight years in prison, prosecutor Armando Spataro said. The other Americans were sentenced to five years. 

Each of the 23 Americans was ordered to pay 1 million euros (about $1.3 million) to Abu Omar, plus 500,000 euros to his wife. ",Who wants the chief?,Italy,"Italy wants the former CIA base chief Robert Seldon Lady who was convicted by an Italian court for his role in a 2003 rendition case.

294,cnn,"(CNN) -- Before he was Pope Benedict XVI, before he earned the nickname ""Cardinal No"" as the enforcer of church doctrine, he was Joseph Ratzinger -- the son of Maria and police officer Joseph Ratzinger, learning about life and God in Germany between two world wars. 

According to Roman Catholic doctrine, Benedict is not only the church's leader but God's representative on earth and infallible. 

He is also a man -- one who savors his meat and potatoes, an accomplished pianist who loves Mozart, and a teacher who for years commanded university classes. His humanity became apparent Monday, when the Vatican announced he'd resign at month's end ""because of advanced age,"" becoming the first pope in nearly 600 years to do so. 

After his birth on April 16, 1927, in Marktl am Inn, in southeastern Germany near the Austrian border, Ratzinger's early years were defined by his country and the turbulent times, as well as his faith. 

Adolf Hitler rose to power during Ratzinger's adolescent years in Traunstein, in the heavily Catholic region of Bavaria. When he was 14, school officials followed Nazi officials' orders and enrolled him and the rest of his class in the Hitler Youth movement -- against his will, Ratzinger wrote in his memoir. 

He left the organization shortly thereafter, because he was studying for the priesthood. But in 1943, Ratzinger was brought back into the Nazi fold upon being drafted into the German army. 

For the next two years, Ratzinger served his country as part of an anti-aircraft unit. But in the waning days of World War II, he deserted -- and was taken prisoner by the U.S. Army.

323,cnn,"(CNN) -- If the global economy remains sluggish, a small corner of the British horse racing hub of Newmarket is very much bucking the trend. 

It is nearly quarter of a millennium since Richard Tattersall founded his eponymous bloodstock auctioneers and, in 2013, Tattersalls' business is booming. 

Back in October behind the gates of Tattersalls Park Paddocks, a record was set for the most ever spent on a horse in Europe -- $8.4 million (£5.25 million) -- for the Galileo filly by Alluring Park. 

In a nod to its old roots, all sales are still priced in guineas (effectively a pound and a shilling) so Qatari Sheikh Joann al Thani parted with five million guineas for the honor of buying this prestigious filly. 

Excitement, though, is building at Tattersalls once more with the first offering from Frankel having retired and gone to stud with the pregnant Dancing Rain undoubtedly the most mouth-watering prospect going under the hammer at the two-week December sale, which starts on November 25. 

Dancing Rain won both the Oaks and its German equivalent and it is more than 50 years since an Oaks winner carrying her first foal has been sold in public auction. 

The fact the foal she is carrying is the offspring of Frankel, with 14 wins from as many races and undoubtedly the most acclaimed horse of its generation, makes the prospect all the more exciting.

He was doing stand-up comedy in Washington when the two were set up on a blind date. They fell in love and she left school to support his burgeoning career in entertainment. 

By 1964, the two were married and they would go on to have five children together. In 1997, their son Ennis (who inspired the character Theo Huxtable) was murdered, and a few years later Dr. Camille Cosby did a one-on-one with Oprah explaining how she'd eventually been able to find joy after mourning the loss of a child. 

Throughout that interview it was so clear that you were looking at the real-life Clair Huxtable that even Oprah seemed a bit star-struck by her poise and grace. 

During her 2000 appearance on Oprah, Camille revealed: 

""I became keenly aware of myself in my mid-thirties. I went through a transition. I decided to go back to school, because I had dropped out of college to marry Bill when I was 19. I had five children, and I decided to go back. I didn't feel fulfilled educationally. I dropped out of school at the end of my sophomore year. So I went back, and when I did, my self-esteem grew. I got my master's, then decided to get my doctoral degree. Education helped me to come out of myself."" 

When asked why she wasn't content to just settle for being the wife of a famous entertainer she continued: ",In what year of school had she quit?,sophomore,"Camille Cosby revealed that she quit school at the end of her sophomore year in order to marry Bill Cosby when she was 19.

360,cnn,"(CNN) -- The driver of a Toyota Prius says he was taken on a wild ride Monday after the car's accelerator became stuck, reaching speeds in excess of 90 mph on a winding, hilly portion of a southern California interstate. 

It took the California Highway Patrol to bring the car safely to a stop. 

The driver, Jim Sikes, said he was traveling east on Interstate 8 outside of the San Diego area when he attempted to pass a slower vehicle. 

""I pushed the gas pedal to pass a car, and it just did something kind of funny ... and it just stuck there,"" he said at a news conference outside a Highway Patrol office. ""As I was going, I was trying the brakes ... and it just kept speeding up."" 

Sikes said he called 911 for help, and dispatchers talked him through instructions on how he might be able to stop the car. But nothing worked. 

At one point, Sikes said he reached down to try to pull the accelerator up, but it ""stayed right where it was."" 

Alerted by emergency dispatchers, a California Highway Patrol officer was able to catch up to Sikes' Prius and used the patrol car's public address system to instruct Sikes to apply the brakes and the emergency brake at the same time. 

The tactic worked, and the car slowed to about 50 mph. Sikes said he was able to shut off the car, and it rolled to a stop. The responding officer, Todd Neibert, positioned his patrol car in front of the Prius as a precaution to prevent it from moving again. ",Who called 911?,Jim Sikes,"The driver, Jim Sikes, said he called 911 for help.

371,cnn,"The exact number of exonerated American prisoners is unknown. But data gathered by university law schools indicates it's more than 2,000. Fascinating details surrounding some of these exonerations set them apart from the rest. Here are five recent exonerations that made headlines. 

1. Michael Morton 

The subject of a CNN film, Michael Morton wasn't home when his wife, Christine, was beaten to death in front of their 3-year-old son at their Austin, Texas-area home in 1986. But a prosecutor said the evidence suggested otherwise. The problem was, the jury was prevented from hearing all the evidence in the case. 

Wrongly convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison, a team of loyal supporters and DNA evidence helped Morton win his freedom in 2011. Last month, Morton's former prosecutor pleaded no contest to a court order to show cause regarding evidence that was not used in the trial.

2. Brian Banks and the incredible twist 

At age 17, fearing a potentially long sentence, college football hopeful Brian Banks followed the advice of his attorney and pleaded no contest to assaulting a Long Beach, California, high school classmate in 2002. 

Banks maintained his innocence throughout nearly six years of imprisonment, subsequent probation and registration as a sex offender. 

But in 2011, the case took an incredible twist when the alleged victim sent Banks a Facebook friend request. 

According to the California Innocence Project, the woman later admitted that Banks had not kidnapped or raped her during a consensual encounter at Long Beach Polytechnic High School, where Banks was a middle linebacker with a scholarship offer from the University of Southern California.

380,cnn,"(CNN) -- Garrick Utley, who worked as a globetrotting foreign correspondent during the flush decades of network news, has died at age 74 of prostate cancer, his wife of 40 years said Friday. 

""He has been fighting -- as you always call it -- prostate cancer for two years,"" Gertje Utley said. ""He had a very, very rare, very aggressive kind."" 

He died Thursday night at his home in New York overlooking Central Park, she said. 

""He was really the old kind of journalist,"" she said of her husband, who reported from more than 75 countries. ""He was the old kind of trenchcoat-clad journalist who wrote his own copy -- always wrote his own copy."" 

During his early years at NBC, the network did not scrimp on devoting resources to newsgathering, she said. ""That's what he always talked about: The early days were the lucky days."" 

Born in Chicago in 1939 to a radio and television news couple, Clifton and Frayn Utley, Garrick graduated from Carleton College and studied at the Army Language School in Monterey, California, before winning a Fulbright Scholarship and moving to Berlin to study East-West relations, she said. 

In 1963, NBC's John Chancellor -- who had worked for Utley's father -- hired him as an office assistant in the network's bureau in Brussels, Belgium, she said. 

After NBC News's ""Huntley-Brinkley Report"" expanded that year from 15 minutes to half an hour, the network was looking for more material, and Utley caught the eye of the brass.

390,cnn,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A habitually violent young man was convicted Wednesday of the murder of teenage actor Rob Knox, who had starred in the latest ""Harry Potter"" film. 

The father, brother and mother of Rob Knox pose together after the death of the young actor. 

Karl Bishop, 22, attacked Knox and four friends with two kitchen knives outside a bar in Sidcup, south east London, last May. He stabbed them 10 times in less than two minutes, the Old Bailey court in central London heard. 

Knox, 18, had rushed out of the bar after he heard that Bishop had threatened his younger brother Jamie but he ended up being stabbed five times, once in a main artery. He died in hospital later that night. 

Bystanders said Bishop's face was ""screwed up in rage"" as he lashed out with the two knives, the Press Association reported. 

Days before the attack, the actor had finished filming on ""Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince,"" due for international release in July, in which he played the role of Marcus Belby. He was set to reprise the part in future ""Harry Potter"" films. 

Knox's father Colin told mourners at his funeral, including co-star Rupert Grint, that his son had been ""living the dream,"" PA said. 

Prosecutor Brian Altman told the court that the young actor's promising life was ended by a ""habitual knife carrier"" who believed stabbing people was an ""occupational hazard"" and had previous convictions for knife crime. 

Bishop is due to be sentenced on Thursday.

402,cnn,"(CNN) -- In the mid-1970s, Gloria Estefan was studying psychology, international law and French at the University of Miami and singing with a local band on the side. She was planning to head to the Sorbonne to further her studies. But then Emilio Estefan swept her off her feet, and their band, the Miami Sound Machine, would soon sweep the nation with its Conga beat. 

Estefan never made it to the Sorbonne, but she launched an enduring musical career that has made her into a beloved international artist. 

Thirty-five years later, she remains married to that first and only boyfriend. And the seven-time Grammy winner has now released ""The Standards,"" an album of classic American tunes with a Gloria Estefan twist. It opens with ""Good Morning Heartache,"" and moves on to songs like ""They Can't Take That Away From Me,"" ""What A Difference A Day Makes,"" ""Eu Sei Que Vou Te Amar"" and ""Young at Heart."" 

The album, she said, brings her career back to some of those first shaky steps onto the national stage. 

""It's such a natural thing for me, something that I wanted to do so long and 25 years ago when I danced the conga on 'The Tonight Show.' I sang 'Good Morning Heartache' with my piano player as a second song and this is like full circle,"" Estefan said. ""That's why it starts the record.""

412,cnn,"San Francisco (CNN) -- Barry Bonds' former trainer was freed Friday from the prison where he's been held since he refused to testify in the baseball legend's perjury trial two weeks ago. 

With the jury now deliberating the perjury and obstruction of justice case against Bonds, U.S. District Judge Susan Illston ordered Gary Anderson to be released. 

Illston found Anderson in contempt of court on the first day of trial testimony when his lawyer informed her that he would not take the stand to answer questions about Bonds' steroid use. 

It was the third time Anderson chose jail time over testimony. He was sent to prison for several weeks twice before when he refused to appear before a federal grand jury investigating Bonds. 

The absence of the trainer's testimony hampered the government's case against Bonds, who is charged with lying under oath when he testified about his steroids use in 2003 before the grand jury that was investigating an alleged sports doping scandal involving Anderson of the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative. 

Bonds, 46, allegedly lied about knowingly taking performance-enhancing drugs and about being injected by anyone but his doctors. 

The jury of eight women and four men are deciding Bonds' fate in a San Francisco federal courthouse less than two miles from the ballpark where Bonds broke Hank Aaron's major league home run record in August 2007.

413,cnn,"San Francisco (CNN) -- Barry Bonds' former trainer was freed Friday from the prison where he's been held since he refused to testify in the baseball legend's perjury trial two weeks ago. 

With the jury now deliberating the perjury and obstruction of justice case against Bonds, U.S. District Judge Susan Illston ordered Gary Anderson to be released. 

Illston found Anderson in contempt of court on the first day of trial testimony when his lawyer informed her that he would not take the stand to answer questions about Bonds' steroid use.

The absence of the trainer's testimony hampered the government's case against Bonds, who is charged with lying under oath when he testified about his steroids use in 2003 before the grand jury that was investigating an alleged sports doping scandal involving Anderson of the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative.

He is using his 26 marathon in 26 days challenge to raise money and awareness for the Three Square Food Bank of Southern Nevada and to draw attention to the issue of food insecurity in the area. It is likely that his goal is to encourage more people to donate and get involved in addressing the issue of poverty and hunger, not to resent those who already do.

"
449,cnn,"(CNN) -- When people want to give back to their community, they typically pull out their checkbooks. 

Jayson Black decided to pull out his running shoes. 

The 28-year-old IT consultant pledged to run 26.2 miles a day for 26 days -- a total of 681.2 miles -- to raise money and awareness for the Three Square Food Bank of Southern Nevada. 

""My hopes are that people will see and hear about this epic mission and open their eyes a little bit,"" Black said on day eight of his challenge. ""Las Vegas isn't all about the sparkling lights and big hotels and casinos. In the shadows and down the alleys that surround the Strip, people are hungry."" 

The mission 

Black first came to CNN's attention through longtime iReporter Chris Morrow, who was in Las Vegas and read about his campaign. 

Black spent Thanksgiving Day on the street. 

He woke up, went to church and ran all day. After completing his daily marathon, Black came home for a Thanksgiving meal of salad and protein shakes. 

CNN iReport: 26 marathons in 26 days 

He's not complaining. He says he started this challenge to draw attention to impoverished people who go hungry on a daily basis. 

""You drive around any city in the United States, and there's always someone somewhere holding a sign or digging through a garbage can for something to eat,"" he says. ""It's great that everyone donates a turkey at Thanksgiving, but this is something bigger than just Thanksgiving."" 

An estimated 16.2% of the Southern Nevada population is considered ""food insecure,"" meaning people do not know when or from where their next meal will come.

He is using his 26 marathon in 26 days challenge to raise money and awareness for the Three Square Food Bank of Southern Nevada and to draw attention to the issue of food insecurity in the area. He is indicating that while donating a turkey at Thanksgiving is a good gesture, it is not enough to solve the problem of hunger, which is a daily issue for many people in Southern Nevada. He is highlighting that there is a need for ongoing support and efforts to address poverty and hunger, not just during Thanksgiving but all year round.

486,cnn,"(CNN)The bored teenager who gunned down a college baseball player in Oklahoma simply because he and his two friends ""had nothing to do,"" is now a convicted murderer. 

Chancey Allen Luna was found guilty of first-degree murder Friday for his role in the August 2013 drive-by shooting of Christopher Lane, a 23-year-old college student in Duncan, about 80 miles south of Oklahoma City. Luna was 16 at the time of the shooting. 

Lane, an Australian attending East Central University, was jogging when he was shot in the back by a gun fired by Luna. 

A jury recommended Friday that Luna spend life in prison without the possibility of parole, according to court records. Because he was under 18 when the crime was committed, he is not eligible for the death penalty. He'll be formally sentenced in June. 

The vehicle's driver, Michael Jones, pleaded guilty in March to second-degree murder and was sentenced to life in prison. Jones, who was 17 at the time of the murder, will be eligible for parole starting in 2051, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. 

Prosecutors dropped first-degree murder charges filed against the third suspect, then only 15, after he agreed to testify against Luna and Jones, according to CNN affiliate KSWO. He will now be tried as a juvenile with accessory to murder after the fact. 

Duncan police Chief Danny Ford told Australian radio station 3AW that when police arrested the teens, Jones offered a motive that made clear that Lane, a baseball player on scholarship, was chosen at random. ",Why not?,he was under 18,"Luna was not eligible for the death penalty because he was under 18 at the time of the crime. According to US laws, the death penalty is not typically applied to individuals under the age of 18. This is due to the fact that the US legal system recognizes that children and adolescents lack the maturity and judgement of adults and are less culpable for their actions.

Jang, who has been married to Kim's sister since 1972, currently serves as a director of the Workers' Party, Yonhap said.

505,cnn,"(CNN) -- NASCAR's Hall of Fame class for 2015 includes Bill Elliott, one of its most popular drivers ever, and Wendell Scott, the only African-American to win a top-level race, the auto racing sanctioning body announced Wednesday. 

Three other drivers -- Fred Lorenzen, Joe Weatherly and Rex White -- will be inducted at a ceremony on January 30 at the NASCAR Hall of Fame in Charlotte, North Carolina. 

Elliott won one Winston Cup title and 44 races in his 37-year career, including two victories at the Daytona 500. Known as ""Awesome Bill from Dawsonville"", a reference to his Georgia hometown, Elliott won the series top circuit championship in 1988. He was voted NASCAR's most popular driver a record 16 times. 

In 1963, Scott became the only African-American to win a race at NASCAR's highest level, taking a 100-mile feature at Jacksonville, Florida, on December 1. He also was the first African-American to race full time in NASCAR's premier series, called the Grand National Series at the time. 

Scott made the top 10 in 30% of the races in his 13-year Grand National career. He was portrayed in the 1977 movie ""Greased Lightning"" by Richard Pryor. He died in 1990. 

Lorenzen was considered one of the sport's first superstars and won 26 races while running a part-time schedule in the 1960s and early 1970s. 

Weatherly was a two-time champion, in 1962 and in 1963, when he raced for nine different teams. 

White was a short-track specialist in the early days of NASCAR. And since there were few super speedways, White finished in the top five about half the time. He won the 1960 championship and 28 races in his career (only twice at tracks longer than a mile).

515,cnn,"(CNN) -- Long before Chen Guangcheng became internationally known as a human rights crusader, villagers near his home knew him as the man to go to when they had trouble with local authorities. 

Despite having little formal legal education, Chen began advocating on behalf of villagers in 1996 at the age of 25, according to China Human Rights Defenders, a China-based human rights group. 

Chen has been at the center of a burgeoning international impasse since his dramatic escape last week from the guards who kept him under house arrest in a small village in eastern China. He was confined to his home after serving four years in prison, apparently over his legal advocacy for what he called victims of abusive practices such as forced abortions by China's family planning officials. 

Fellow activists say he made his way to the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, where he remains as the United States and China try to sort out the future for Chen, who has sought to call attention to the practice of forced abortions and sterilizations in China. 

Yet he never sought out to be a rabble-rouser, said New York University law professor Jerome Cohen, who first met Chen when the activist traveled to the United States as part of a State Department program in 2004.

Here's what she didn't expect on top of all that: sharing a hospital room with a feverish 6-year-old and contracting a nasty bacterial infection her mother says nearly killed her.

Because of the infection she picked up at the hospital, Katie, who was 19 at the time, dropped from 120 to 90 pounds. 

The bacterium that made her so sick is called Clostridium difficile, and according to a study out this week, it's more common than ever among hospitalized children in the United States, and children who get it are more likely to die or require surgery. 

The study found Clostridium difficile infections in hospitalized children went up 15% per year from 1997, when there were 3,565 infections, to 2006, when there were 7,779 infections. 

The study looked at 10.5 million pediatric patients from 1997 to 2006, of whom 21,274, or 0.2%, had C. diff, as the bacteria are commonly called. The study was published this week in the Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine.

617,cnn,"A senior Palestinian Authority official died Wednesday after a confrontation with Israeli troops, prompting President Mahmoud Abbas to halt security coordination with Israel, according to Palestinian officials. 

Ziyad Abu Ein died after clashes with Israeli soldiers midday Wednesday in the Palestinian village of Turmusaya, which is northeast of the West Bank city of Ramallah, longtime chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat said in a statement. Abu Ein -- a minister in Abbas' Fatah party and head of the Committee to Resist the Wall and Settlements -- was there participating in nonviolent demonstrations to mark international Human Rights Day, according to Erakat's statement. 

There were varying reports of exactly how Abu Ein died, including what role -- if any -- Israeli authorities played in it. 

Pictures from various news agencies depict an Israeli soldier with his hands to Abu Ein's neck, followed by another showing him on the ground. The official Palestinian news agency WAFA, meanwhile, reported that the Palestinian official lost consciousness after he inhaled tear gas and an Israeli soldier hit him in the chest. 

""The Israeli soldiers called Abu Ein by name and seemed to be focused on him,"" witness Kamal Abu Safaka told CNN. ""There was a lot of pushing, kicking and punching by the soldiers. ... When Abu Ein tried to intercede, they hit him on the chest with a rifle butt and grabbed him by the throat and pushed him back and then threw a large amount of tear gas and stun grenades."" 

Dr. Ahmed Bitawi, the director of the Ramallah hospital that inspected Abu Ein's body, said he died from asphyxiation after choking on vomit brought on by tear gas inhalation. ",what caused Ziyad death,unknown,"The cause of Ziyad Abu Ein's death is disputed. Some reports indicate that he died from asphyxiation after choking on vomit brought on by tear gas inhalation, while others suggest that an Israeli soldier hit him in the chest and grabbed him by the throat. The official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported that the Palestinian official lost consciousness after inhaling tear gas.

618,cnn,"(CNN) -- It's a number that even astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson is having a hard time wrapping his brilliant mind around.

By then, he was on a roll. Earlier in the day, he tweeted, ""QUESTION: This year, what do all the world's Muslims and Jews call December 25th? ANSWER: Thursday."" 

His comments drew criticism and name-calling from various corners of the internet. ""Overly reductive, deliberately cynical and unnecessarily provocative,"" one person said on Twitter. 

Another accused him of ""trolling Christmas today to show you how smart he is."" 

Tyson's response to the controversy? ""Imagine a world in which we are all enlightened by objective truths rather than offended by them."" 

Later Friday, Tyson pondered ""My Most Retweeted Tweet"" in a Facebook post. He did not defend or disavow his comments. Instead, in true scientific form, he attempted to quantify their popularity compared to previous tweets. 

""My sense in this case is that the high rate of re-tweeting, is not to share my enthusiasm of this fact, but is driven by accusations that the tweet is somehow anti-Christian,"" he wrote.

638,cnn,"Attorney General Eric Holder is not entirely ruling out a scenario under which a drone strike would be ordered against Americans on U.S. soil, but says it has never been done previously and he could only see it being considered in an extraordinary circumstance. 

He began to winnow the list of those possible extraordinary circumstances Wednesday. In testimony Wednesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, pressed Holder whether he believed it would be constitutional to target an American terror suspect ""sitting at a cafe"" if the suspect didn't pose an imminent threat. 

""No,"" Holder replied. 

But he also said the government has no intention of carrying out drone strikes inside the United States. Echoing what he said in a letter to U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, he called the possibility of domestic drone strikes ""entirely hypothetical."" 

That letter, released Tuesday, was prompted by questions raised over the nomination of John Brennan to head the CIA. Specifically, members of the Senate Intelligence Committee sought the Obama administration's legal rationale for its use of drones to kill terror suspects overseas. 

But Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican who has said he would do what he could to hold up Brennan's nomination until he got a full answer to his query, wanted to know whether the administration considered that policy applicable domestically. 

Holder: Drone strike against Americans in the U.S. possible 

In a letter to Paul dated on Monday, Holder said it was possible, ""I suppose,"" to imagine an ""extraordinary circumstance in which it would be necessary and appropriate"" under U.S. law for the president to authorize the military to ""use lethal force"" within the United States.

But he also said the government has no intention of carrying out drone strikes inside the United States. Echoing what he said in a letter to U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, he called the possibility of domestic drone strikes ""entirely hypothetical."" 

That letter, released Tuesday, was prompted by questions raised over the nomination of John Brennan to head the CIA. Specifically, members of the Senate Intelligence Committee sought the Obama administration's legal rationale for its use of drones to kill terror suspects overseas. 

But Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican who has said he would do what he could to hold up Brennan's nomination until he got a full answer to his query, wanted to know whether the administration considered that policy applicable domestically. 

Holder: Drone strike against Americans in the U.S. possible

649,cnn,"(CNN) -- England international defender Ashley Cole turned goal scorer as his late winner at Stamford Bridge Saturday gave Chelsea a 1-0 win over Stoke City to stay top of the English Premier League. 

Cole was finding the net for the first time in over two years and he left it until the 85th minute, set up by a brilliant pass by Spain's Juan Mata. 

His team had been made to struggle by the battling visitors and looked set for a fourth game without a win in all competitions before the full back's late intervention. 

""I had a few shots in the first half and took too much time on the ball with them, but this time, the first thing that came into my brain was to dink it and I just did it,"" Cole said. 

""It is mentally good to get a lead in the league table."" 

Fernando Torres scuffed Chelsea's best chance but Stoke might have gone ahead in the first half when a Jonathan Walters' header hit the crossbar. 

The striker was also subjected to a strong challenge late in the game from Chelsea defender David Luiz, which left the Brazilian lucky to escape a straight red card. 

Luiz, who signed from Benfica last year, sealed a new five-year contract with the Blues later Saturday, extending his deal to 2017. 

""It is a great club and I look forward to winning more trophies here. I want to play for a long time at the top level -- which is what playing for Chelsea means,"" he told the club's official website. ",Who did Chelsea defeat?,Stoke City.,"Chelsea defeated Stoke City.

660,cnn,"(CNN) -- A June trial has been set for a Detroit-area man who said he accidentally shot and killed a 19-year-old woman he thought was breaking into his home. 

Theodore Paul Wafer, 54, pleaded not guilty at his arraignment Wednesday to second-degree murder charges in connection with the November 2, 2013 shooting of Renisha McBride. Authorities said McBride was intoxicated and possibly disoriented following a car crash before Wafer shot her on his porch in the community of Dearborn Heights. 

The trial was set for June 2. 

Last month, District Court Judge David Turfe said there was enough probable cause for Wafer to stand trial in connection with the shooting. 

""Defendant came to the door with the shotgun,"" Turfe said, according to CNN Michigan affiliate WXYZ. ""His first thought was to bring the gun, not call for help, or not answer the door. It suggests to this court, the defendant made a bad choice."" 

A friend of McBride told the court that she and the victim had been playing a drinking game with vodka and smoking marijuana the night of the shooting. 

Wafer, whose lawyer said he shot the victim in self-defense, was charged with second-degree murder last month after days of pressure from McBride's relatives seeking an arrest. 

He also was charged with manslaughter and possession of a firearm in the commission of a felony. 

Wafer told investigators he thought McBride was breaking into his home, and that the shotgun accidentally discharged when he investigated, police said. 

McBride was unarmed and there was no evidence of a break-in, so Wafer -- who authorities say shot McBride from behind a closed, locked screen door -- cannot lawfully claim he needed to shoot her to stop an imminent threat of death or great bodily harm, Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy told reporters in November. ",Why is a man from the Detroit area being tried?,shot and killed a 19-year-old woman,"Theodore Paul Wafer, a man from the Detroit area, is being tried for second-degree murder charges in connection with the November 2, 2013 shooting of Renisha McBride. He is accused of shooting and killing the 19-year-old woman on his porch in the community of Dearborn Heights, after she had been involved in a car crash and was possibly disoriented and intoxicated. Wafer has pleaded not guilty to the charges and claims that he shot McBride in self-defense, believing she was breaking into his home. However, McBride was unarmed and there was no evidence of a break-in and the prosecutor argues that Wafer cannot lawfully claim that he needed to shoot her to stop an imminent threat of death or great bodily harm.

681,cnn,"(CNN) -- Wednesday night's CNN debate lands at a critical moment in the Republican race. 

This season, each debate has set the tone for the primary to follow. Newt Gingrich's savaging of the media helped propel him to victory in South Carolina. Mitt Romney's savaging of Gingrich helped him to clinch Florida. The current uncertainty about the race, and the extraordinary elasticity in the polls, is partly due to the fact that we haven't had a debate for a whole month. 

It's important, then, for each of the candidates to make a powerful impression in this last confrontation before Arizona and Michigan vote on February 28. Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich will compete over who is the most conservative, and Ron Paul will push his unique brand of libertarianism. Same old, same old. But we might see something new from Mitt Romney: a glimmer of humanity. 

The latest CNN/Time/ORC International Poll shows that Santorum is closing the gap on Romney in Arizona, but it's probably in Michigan that he stands the best chance of scoring an upset. A week ago, polls put Santorum as much as 10 points ahead in the Great Lakes State. But now they call it a statistical dead heat between him and Romney. 

So it would serve Santorum well to hit Mitt hard in the debate. This is Rick's natural style -- he gets a thrill out of counting the flaws of his opponents. But Santorum also probably recognizes that the only way he'll win Michigan is by reminding voters of the doubts that they have about Romney's conservatism. That's what he's been doing in the western part of the state all this week, where he has hit out repeatedly at Romney's ""well-oiled weathervane"" stance on issues like abortion and Iran. ",On what night was the debate?,Wednesday,"It is not specified in this text on what night the debate was.

But we might see something new from Mitt Romney: a glimmer of humanity. 

The latest CNN/Time/ORC International Poll shows that Santorum is closing the gap on Romney in Arizona, but it's probably in Michigan that he stands the best chance of scoring an upset. A week ago, polls put Santorum as much as 10 points ahead in the Great Lakes State. But now they call it a statistical dead heat between him and Romney. 

So it would serve Santorum well to hit Mitt hard in the debate. This is Rick's natural style -- he gets a thrill out of counting the flaws of his opponents. But Santorum also probably recognizes that the only way he'll win Michigan is by reminding voters of the doubts that they have about Romney's conservatism.

696,cnn,"(CNN) -- Wednesday night's CNN debate lands at a critical moment in the Republican race. 

This season, each debate has set the tone for the primary to follow. Newt Gingrich's savaging of the media helped propel him to victory in South Carolina. Mitt Romney's savaging of Gingrich helped him to clinch Florida. The current uncertainty about the race, and the extraordinary elasticity in the polls, is partly due to the fact that we haven't had a debate for a whole month.

701,cnn,"London, England (CNN) -- Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic finally took the stand Monday at the U.N.'s international tribunal at The Hague to defend himself against genocide charges stemming from the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict. 

For CNN's Senior International Correspondent Nic Robertson, the 64 year-old was as defiant and unrepentant as the man he recalled meeting outside Sarajevo in 1993-94, as Bosnian-Serb forces shelled the city. 

Karadzic, who faces 11 charges of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide during the war, told the tribunal the Serb cause is ""just and holy,"" and dismissed as myths two of the worst atrocities of a conflict that claimed 100,000 lives -- the three-year siege of Sarajevo and the Srebrenica massacre in 1995. 

He even claimed that the image of the Muslims as victims was untrue and that they were the first to attack. Their fighters ""had blood up to their shoulders,"" he said. 

""I will defend that nation of ours and their cause that is just and holy,"" he said in his defiant opening statement. The aim of the ""Muslim plotters,"" he added, was ""100 percent power, as it was in the Ottoman Empire."" 

""This is reminiscent of those days,"" said Robertson, who reported from the Bosnian capital during the war. ""These were the exact same justifications: 'we're the ones that had been under attack, we're the ones being wronged.'

706,cnn,"(CNN) -- Bagpipers sounded ""Amazing Grace"" on a snowy day at a Utah cemetery as military pallbearers marched to rest the casket of Pfc. Aaron Thomas Nemelka, one of 13 people gunned down last week in Ford Hood, Texas. 

A throng of mourners arrived for the funeral service at a Mormon church in West Jordan, and then solemnly witnessed the burial of the 19-year-old combat engineer set for deployment in Afghanistan. 

One of six of the Fort Hood victims laid to rest across the country on Saturday, Nemelka was buried at the Utah Veterans Memorial Park, south of Bluffdale. 

American flags flapped in the freezing wind and a soldier played ""Taps"" amid a graveside huddle of military comrades, veterans, family members and Patriot Guard Riders, the motorcycle group that honors slain troops. 

""This one is a little bit hard to understand,"" said Utah Gov. Gary Herbert, who spoke to reporters after the church service. 

He said Nemelka's death is particularly hard to accept because of the circumstances. 

Authorities say Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, a U.S. Army psychiatrist, opened fire at a military processing center at Fort Hood on November 5, killing 13 people. Hasan, who was seriously wounded in the incident, was charged with 13 counts of premeditated murder -- charges that make him eligible for the death penalty. 

Nemelka graduated from high school in 2008 and enlisted the same year, and then was ready to deploy to Afghanistan in January. 

The youngest of four children, Nemelka loved his work as a combat engineer and was being trained to defuse bombs, according to a report in Salt Lake City's Deseret News posted on the Nemelka family Web page.

Residents throughout Atlanta are outraged by hundreds, even thousands of dollars in monthly spikes in their water bills, and have questioned the legitimacy of the charges for years. Now, they're demanding answers.

Over two months last summer, her family's monthly water bill, shot up to $1,805 In July and then $1,084 in August, leaving a balance due of more than $3,000. She said in the past her bill has averaged $200 to $250. 

""I'm not paying a $3,000 bill. And for those three months, we were pretty much out of town most of the time and there's no leaks,"" she said, showing CNN a copy of her plumber's report.

In the end, comedian Kevin Nealon and his wife decided to name their son Gable. As in Clark Gable. They simply liked the sound of it, and most people will agree it's far better than Helsinki, 43rd Avenue or Never Ending Pasta Bowl. 

This was 4Â½ years ago, but the former ""Saturday Night Live"" star still loves to talk about his son. In 2009, he even published a book about becoming a first-time dad called ""Yes, You're Pregnant, But What About Me?"" 

""We finally got the pacifier away from him,"" Nealon says of Gable. ""And now we're potty training him. It would've been easier to get the pacifier away from him if we taught him how to pee on it.""

746,cnn,"(CNN)After weeks of controversy and the sudden departures of two co-hosts, ""Fashion Police"" is going on an extended break. 

The fashion commentary show on E! channel announced Tuesday that it will be on hiatus until September. 

""We look forward to taking this opportunity to refresh the show before the next awards season,"" it said in a statement. 

The announcement caps a rocky few months. 

Last week, co-host Kathy Griffin bid the show bye-bye after seven episodes, saying her style did not blend in with her co-hosts. She made a dig at the show on her way out. 

""There is plenty to make fun of in pop culture without bringing people's bodies into it,"" she said in a statement. ""I do not want to use my comedy to contribute to a culture of unattainable perfectionism and intolerance towards difference."" 

Shortly before her departure, co-host Giuliana Rancic faced backlash last month for suggesting that Disney star Zendaya Coleman's dreadlocks smelled of marijuana. 

Rancic later issued an on-air apology to the 18-year-old after social media jumped to the teen's defense. 

But her apology was not enough for co-host Kelly Osbourne, who criticized her remarks and quit a few days later. 

Rancic and fellow co-host Brad Goreski will return in September, along with executive producer Melissa Rivers.

773,cnn,"Miami (CNN) -- Two South Florida imams and a third family member were arrested Saturday on charges of providing support to the Pakistani Taliban, the Justice Department said.

791,cnn,"Harare, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- South African leader Jacob Zuma was in neighboring Zimbabwe this week to rescue the seemingly crumbling power-sharing government of President Robert Mugabe and Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai. 

The South African president's visit Friday to the capital, Harare, follows escalating tensions between the two leaders, with Tsvangirai this week taking Mugabe to court for making unilateral decisions in the 21-month-old government. 

After a more than six-hour meeting with Mugabe and Tsvangirai, who have not been on speaking terms for close to a month, Zuma said he had managed to break the impasse between the two. 

""We have met and we have had successful consultations on a number of issues,"" Zuma told journalists. ""They were small issues. There had been a breakdown of communication with the leaders of the government which have been resolved, and meetings will resume."" 

Zuma joked and smiled with journalists, but that was not the case with Mugabe and Tsvangirai, who remained tense throughout the short press briefing. They refused to talk to journalists as they separately left the meetings. 

""No comment. No comment. Talk to the mediator, President Zuma,"" Tsvangirai told journalists about how his meeting with Zuma and Mugabe went. Mugabe just waved to reporters before he jumped into his car. 

Zuma -- who was appointed by regional leaders to monitor Zimbabwe's fragile coalition government and mediate -- said he would brief his counterparts in the 15-member Southern African Development Community (SADC) about the tension in Zimbabwe.

811,cnn,"Bob Dylan is being investigated on suspicion of inciting hatred in Paris over comments he made in Rolling Stone magazine, French prosecutors said Tuesday. 

An organization representing Croatians in France pressed charges against Dylan for allegedly comparing the conflict between Croatians and Serbs to the Nazis' persecution of Jews in an interview last year for the French edition of Rolling Stone. 

""If you got a slave master or Klan in your blood, blacks can sense that. That stuff lingers to this day. Just like Jews can sense Nazi blood and the Serbs can sense Croatian blood,"" the influential singer-songwriter was quoted as saying. 

While a Croatian group has said Dylan was referencing the violence that came with the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, it's unclear whether the long-outspoken musician was referring to Yugoslavia or the crimes committed when the Ustasha ruled Croatia during World War II. 

The Paris prosecutor's office said Dylan was placed under formal investigation last month by the Paris Main Court for ""public injury"" and ""incitement to hatred."" 

Vlatko Maric, secretary general of the Representative Council of the Croatian Community and Institutions, told CNN his organization had brought the case almost a year ago. 

Explaining the council's decision to pursue the case against Dylan, Maric said the artist's remarks in Rolling Stone were of a ""rare violence"" that had deeply shocked people from a nation still wounded by the conflict of the 1990s. 

""An entire people is being compared to criminal organizations"" like the Nazis or the Ku Klux Klan, he said. ""The Croatians are peaceful people who respect Bob Dylan as an artist, but we must remind him that he can't make such remarks.

819,cnn,"Bob Dylan is being investigated on suspicion of inciting hatred in Paris over comments he made in Rolling Stone magazine, French prosecutors said Tuesday. 

An organization representing Croatians in France pressed charges against Dylan for allegedly comparing the conflict between Croatians and Serbs to the Nazis' persecution of Jews in an interview last year for the French edition of Rolling Stone. 

""If you got a slave master or Klan in your blood, blacks can sense that. That stuff lingers to this day. Just like Jews can sense Nazi blood and the Serbs can sense Croatian blood,"" the influential singer-songwriter was quoted as saying. 

While a Croatian group has said Dylan was referencing the violence that came with the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, it's unclear whether the long-outspoken musician was referring to Yugoslavia or the crimes committed when the Ustasha ruled Croatia during World War II. 

The Paris prosecutor's office said Dylan was placed under formal investigation last month by the Paris Main Court for ""public injury"" and ""incitement to hatred."" 

Vlatko Maric, secretary general of the Representative Council of the Croatian Community and Institutions, told CNN his organization had brought the case almost a year ago. 

Explaining the council's decision to pursue the case against Dylan, Maric said the artist's remarks in Rolling Stone were of a ""rare violence"" that had deeply shocked people from a nation still wounded by the conflict of the 1990s. 

""An entire people is being compared to criminal organizations"" like the Nazis or the Ku Klux Klan, he said. ""The Croatians are peaceful people who respect Bob Dylan as an artist, but we must remind him that he can't make such remarks.

821,cnn,"(CNN) -- Lewis Hamilton has always been driven by his emotions -- for better or for worse -- but has he found a new level of maturity with Mercedes? 

The double world champion has been schooled in the harsh lessons that Formula One can mete out since he joined McLaren's junior program when just 13 years old. 

But, despite this careful education by one of the most straight laced teams in F1, the British boy racer cannot help wearing his heart on his sleeve. 

There have been some heady highs and mesmerizing meltdowns in his eight-year career at the highest level of motorsport. 

Fizzing with energy, he bounded into the sport in 2007 and refused to lie down when faced with Fernando Alonso, a double world champion, as his feisty McLaren teammate. 

With Alonso gone after a single acrimonious season, Hamilton drove the McLaren to the 2008 title with ""my heart in my mouth."" 

At just 23 years old, he had sensationally clinched the championship at the last corner, of the last lap, of the last race to deny Ferrari's Felipe Massa -- and a seething crowd of home fans -- in Brazil. 

If 2008 was the young gun's giddy zenith, the 2011 campaign was his gut-wrenching nadir.

There have been some heady highs and mesmerizing meltdowns in his eight-year career at the highest level of motorsport. 

Fizzing with energy, he bounded into the sport in 2007 and refused to lie down when faced with Fernando Alonso, a double world champion, as his feisty McLaren teammate. 

With Alonso gone after a single acrimonious season, Hamilton drove the McLaren to the 2008 title with ""my heart in my mouth."" 

At just 23 years old, he had sensationally clinched the championship at the last corner, of the last lap, of the last race to deny Ferrari's Felipe Massa -- and a seething crowd of home fans -- in Brazil. 

If 2008 was the young gun's giddy zenith, the 2011 campaign was his gut-wrenching nadir. 

His long-distance relationship with American pop star Nicole Scherzinger was more off than on and he had ditched his dad Anthony as manager in favor of a high-profile agency. 

Hamilton teetered on the edge of controversy and despair. The torch paper was lit at the Monaco Grand Prix when he was penalized by the race stewards. ",Which race was he penalized in?,the Monaco Grand Prix,"Hamilton was penalized in the Monaco Grand Prix.

857,cnn,"On paper, the race in Kentucky between Sen. Mitch McConnell and his Democratic challenger, Alison Lundergan Grimes, should be pretty clear-cut: The experienced veteran easily beats a political novice. But like most things, it's not. 

McConnell must cross the first hurdle by beating his primary challenger, Matt Bevin, before he engages in what is expected to be one of the most expensive and bitterly fought Senate campaigns this midterm season. 

A lot is at stake overall in November: control of the Senate and the political fate of one of the most powerful Republicans in Washington. 

Grimes' advantage 

Grimes, 35, was just 7 when McConnell was first elected to the Senate. 

Mitch McConnell would face biggest challenge yet in Alison Grimes 

While he rose up the ranks in Washington and became Senate Republican leader, Grimes practiced law and won statewide office as secretary of state in 2011. 

Despite her short political career, like McConnell, her name carries weight -- for better or worse. 

Grimes' family has a long history in state Democratic politics. Her father, Jerry, was the former chairman of the Kentucky Democratic Party and a state legislator. But he was forced out of those roles over legal problems facing his catering company. 

While the family name has been battered, its connections survive: She'll have access to the deep pockets and support of her father's allies, including Bill and Hillary Clinton.

862,cnn,"(CNN) -- It has been a rocky couple of years for the people of Egypt. Since the 2011 revolution, the economy has tanked, street protests are an almost daily occurrence and the political situation remains volatile. 

However, a handful of young Egyptians have found that the best way to take a stand against the turmoil is with stand-up comedy. 

""We are like a little beam of sunlight, coming through and reminding people, 'Don't worry! When this cloud passes, it will be brighter. It will be happier,'"" says Rami Borai, a comedian in one of Egypt's first home-grown comedy troupes, Hezb El Comedy. 

The group, whose name means ""The Comedy Party,"" was formed in 2009 by Hashim Al Gahry, who admits he started up with ""zero capital."" Al Gahry and some friends pooled their savings, and started marketing the group through social media. When they're not performing, Hezb El Comedy teaches the art of stand-up to other aspiring comics, instructing them on things like timing and body language. 

""We're not the funniest people in the world, but it's the experience that has put us in a position to give them advice and tell them, 'These are our mistakes, and this is what you can do to avoid what we did,'"" says Al Gahry.

873,cnn,"(CNN) -- Former English Premier League referees have jumped to the defense of Howard Webb after criticism of his performance in Sunday's World Cup final. 

Webb, the first referee to officiate the European Champions League final and World Cup final in the same season, dished out 13 yellow cards and one red as Spain defeated the Netherlands 1-0 in a tempestuous clash at Soccer City, Johannesburg. 

Dutch coach Bert Van Marwijk and several of his players suggested the English official favored the Spanish, and Netherlands fans booed Webb and his assistants when they collected their medals after the game. 

But ex-referee Jeff Winter, who took charge of several fiery encounters between English giants like Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool, was full of praise for Webb's performance in extremely testing circumstances. 

""I thought he had a superb game,"" Winter told CNN. ""I find it very difficult to remember a more testing game than that at any level. I thought the players' behavior and discipline were abysmal.

883,cnn,"Beijing, China (CNN) -- A court in eastern China sentenced a man to death Saturday for attacking 29 kindergarten students and three teachers with a knife, state-run media said. 

The Taixing Intermediate People's Court found Xu Yuyuan, 47, guilty of intentional homicide after a half-day trial, Xinhua news agency said. 

Xu told the court that his rage against society motivated him in the April 29 attacks, according to Xinhua. But he appealed the death sentence, arguing that the punishment was too severe since no one died in the attacks, Xinhua said. 

Chinese penal code says a person can be convicted of intentional homicide for acting on an intent to kill, the news agency reported. 

A police probe found Xu had been unemployed since 2001, when he was fired by a local insurance company. He told police he carried out the attack because he was angry about a series of business and personal humiliations, Xinhua said. 

About 300 people attended Saturday's open trial, according to Xinhua. 

Xu's sentence was the second death penalty conviction after a recent spate of school attacks that have prompted public outrage across China. 

Zheng Minsheng, 42, was sentenced to death and executed on April 28 for attacking students in front of an elementary school in Fujian province, killing eight and wounding several others. Zheng also used a knife in the attacks, Xinhua reported. 

Authorities said Zheng carried out the attack because he was frustrated at ""failures in his romantic life,"" the news agency said.

The Taixing Intermediate People's Court found Xu Yuyuan, 47, guilty of intentional homicide after a half-day trial, Xinhua news agency said. 

Xu told the court that his rage against society motivated him in the April 29 attacks, according to Xinhua. But he appealed the death sentence, arguing that the punishment was too severe since no one died in the attacks, Xinhua said. 

Chinese penal code says a person can be convicted of intentional homicide for acting on an intent to kill, the news agency reported. 

A police probe found Xu had been unemployed since 2001, when he was fired by a local insurance company. He told police he carried out the attack because he was angry about a series of business and personal humiliations, Xinhua said. 

About 300 people attended Saturday's open trial, according to Xinhua. 

Xu's sentence was the second death penalty conviction after a recent spate of school attacks that have prompted public outrage across China. 

Zheng Minsheng, 42, was sentenced to death and executed on April 28 for attacking students in front of an elementary school in Fujian province, killing eight and wounding several others. Zheng also used a knife in the attacks, Xinhua reported. 

Authorities said Zheng carried out the attack because he was frustrated at ""failures in his romantic life,"" the news agency said. 

At least four other such attacks on school children in China have been reported since March.

901,cnn,"(CNN) -- Music manager Allen Klein, whose clients included the Rolling Stones and the Beatles, died Saturday after a lengthy battle with Alzheimer's disease, his publicist said. Klein was 77. 

The son of Jewish immigrants from Hungary, Klein founded his firm Allen Klein & Co. in the late 1950s before the label evolved into ABKCO Music & Records in New York. The independent label holds the copyrights to music by the Rolling Stones, Sam Cooke, the Animals, the Kinks, Chubby Checker, Bobby Womack and hundreds of others. 

Klein represented dozens of artists, including Sam Cooke, the Animals, Bobby Darin and Herman's Hermits. He changed the music industry when he represented Sam Cooke in negotiations with RCA, winning the artist control of his own master recordings. 

Known for a tenacious and often blunt style in negotiations, Klein's greatest coups were inking contracts with the Rolling Stones and the Beatles, though both relationships ended in legal battles. 

ABKCO built up a catalog of copyrights to more than 2,000 songs, including much of the Stones' 1960s catalog. Klein retained ownership of those titles even after splitting with the Stones. In 1969, John Lennon persuaded the other Beatles that Klein should take over the group's business affairs, but Paul McCartney resisted the move and some music historians say the appointment hastened the Beatles' split. 

Lennon later fell out with Klein, who was thought to be the target of the former Beatle's 1974 song ""Steel and Glass."" 

Defending his tough style, Klein told Playboy magazine in 1971: ""The music business is about 99 percent no-talent losers who can't stand a winner in their midst.""

963,cnn,"(CNN)Mikaela Shiffrin is on course to make skiing history after claiming her third consecutive slalom victory on the World Cup circuit on Saturday. 

The young American is hoping to become the first woman to win both the discipline's world title and overall crown in successive seasons. 

Shiffrin, who retained her slalom title at February's world championships in Colorado, now has a 90-point lead going into next week's World Cup finale in France. 

""I think the first couple races of the season I was pretty arrogant and was like, 'I'm just going to win these, I guess.' And I didn't. I wasn't even close,"" said Shiffrin, who has won the slalom Crystal Globe two years running. 

""When you're racing at a high level -- or doing any sport at a high level -- everybody's going for the win. I learned that I can't take my foot off the gas and expect to win. These last races, I was pushing everything. Any race that I won this season, I was giving my entire heart into it. I'm proud of that."" 

A day after her 20th birthday, Shiffrin won by a comfortable 1.41 seconds at Are in Sweden as she claimed the 14th World Cup win of her career, with Slovakia's Veronika Velez Zuzulova second and Czech Republic's Sarka Strachova third.

974,cnn,"Dallas (CNN) -- The U.S. Supreme Court has delayed the scheduled execution on an inmate on death row in Texas amid questions about a psychologist who testified that blacks and Hispanics were more likely to commit future crimes. 

Duane Edward Buck already had eaten a final meal of fried chicken, fried fish, french fries, salad, jalapeno peppers and apples when news came of the court's decision on Thursday evening, Texas Department of Criminal Justice spokesman Jason Clark said. 

""Praise the Lord Jesus,"" Clark quoted the condemned man as saying. ""God is worthy to be praised. God's mercy triumphs over judgment, and I feel good."" 

Buck had been set to die by lethal injection, but the court delayed the execution to give it time to review the way a lower court handled the case. While that happens, Buck remains on death row. 

Buck was convicted of the 1995 killings of Debra Gardner and Kenneth Butler. According to Texas officials, Buck shot Gardner in front of her daughter, who begged for her mother's life. 

A third person, Phyllis Taylor, was shot, but she sought clemency for Buck this week. The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles, however, recommended against granting Buck clemency 

Buck's attorney, Katherine C. Black, said the recommendation, ""fails to recognize what the highest legal officer in the state of Texas has acknowledged: No one should be executed based on a process tainted by considerations of race."" 

Black is referring to U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, who was the state's attorney general in 2000, when he spoke of seven death row inmates, including Buck. Cornyn said he believed the inmates had been unfairly sentenced to death based on testimony that was racially tainted by psychologist Walter Quijano, who repeatedly told juries that black or Hispanic defendants were more likely to commit future crimes.

985,cnn,"Dallas (CNN) -- The U.S. Supreme Court has delayed the scheduled execution on an inmate on death row in Texas amid questions about a psychologist who testified that blacks and Hispanics were more likely to commit future crimes. 

Duane Edward Buck already had eaten a final meal of fried chicken, fried fish, french fries, salad, jalapeno peppers and apples when news came of the court's decision on Thursday evening, Texas Department of Criminal Justice spokesman Jason Clark said. 

""Praise the Lord Jesus,"" Clark quoted the condemned man as saying. ""God is worthy to be praised. God's mercy triumphs over judgment, and I feel good."" 

Buck had been set to die by lethal injection, but the court delayed the execution to give it time to review the way a lower court handled the case. While that happens, Buck remains on death row. 

Buck was convicted of the 1995 killings of Debra Gardner and Kenneth Butler. According to Texas officials, Buck shot Gardner in front of her daughter, who begged for her mother's life. 

A third person, Phyllis Taylor, was shot, but she sought clemency for Buck this week. The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles, however, recommended against granting Buck clemency 

Buck's attorney, Katherine C. Black, said the recommendation, ""fails to recognize what the highest legal officer in the state of Texas has acknowledged: No one should be executed based on a process tainted by considerations of race."" 

Black is referring to U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, who was the state's attorney general in 2000, when he spoke of seven death row inmates, including Buck. Cornyn said he believed the inmates had been unfairly sentenced to death based on testimony that was racially tainted by psychologist Walter Quijano, who repeatedly told juries that black or Hispanic defendants were more likely to commit future crimes. ",How was Buck set to die?,lethal injection,"Buck had been set to die by lethal injection.
